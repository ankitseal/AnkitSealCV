## üéØ Professional Summary

Senior IoT Solution Architect for **Industry 4.0**, delivering end-to-end **IIoT**, **edge**, and **IT/OT convergence** from presales and solution design through delivery, services & governance, and customer success. I lead technical qualification and bid/tender/RFP responses, craft win-themes and Statements of Work (SoWs), and present tailored demos and PoCs to ops leaders and CxOs.

I design scalable, secure architectures integrating **PLCs/SCADA/MES** with analytics platforms, normalising **OPC UA/MQTT/Modbus** for **OEE**, **predictive maintenance**, and quality insights. I establish SLA/OLA and MTTR targets, ensure reliable handovers with runbooks, and drive adoption via success plans, training, and renewals to maximise ARR and measurable outcomes.
