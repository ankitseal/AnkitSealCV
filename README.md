## üéØ Professional Summary

Senior **IoT Solution Architect** for **Industry 4.0** delivering end-to-end **IIoT**, **edge**, and **IT/OT convergence** from **presales** and solution design through delivery, **services & governance**, and **customer success**. I lead technical qualification and **bid/tender / RFP** responses, craft win-themes and **SoWs**, and present tailored **demos / PoCs** to operations leaders and **CxO** stakeholders.

I design scalable architectures integrating **PLCs / SCADA / MES** with analytics platforms, normalising **OPC UA / MQTT / Modbus** telemetry for **OEE**, **predictive maintenance**, and quality insights. I define **SLA / OLA** & **MTTR** targets, produce runbooks and structured handovers, and post-deployment I drive adoption via success plans, enablement, and expansion to maximise **ARR** and measurable outcomes.
